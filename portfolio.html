                    <h3>Image Steganography Using Spatial Domain Techniques and AES Algorithm</h3>
                    <p> The main objective of this project is to hide the secret message or image inside the image using steganography techniques. Among the steganography techniques the Least Significant 
                        Bit (LSB) ,Adaptive LSB along with pixel Value Differencing(PVD) is used in this project. To protect and provide security for the hidden message or image, Advanced 
                        Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm is used.
